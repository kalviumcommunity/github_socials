# github_socials


<h1>How would I like to improve the world? </h1>

Facilitating connections between GitHub users, the application can help build a vibrant community of developers. This community can provide support, mentorship, and opportunities for growth and career advancement. Strong communities contribute to the overall growth and progress of the tech industry.

<h1>Why is this a problem ?</h1>



GitHub offers a vast repository of open source projects and millions of users, making it challenging for individuals to find like-minded developers or projects aligned with their interests. This application can provide advanced search and filtering functionalities to help users discover relevant users and projects more easily. While GitHub provides some social features like following users or starring repositories, it lacks dedicated tools for developers to connect and network with each other.

<h1>My Potential solutions</h1>



This application will show activities of a github user, their stats, their repositories and a feature where people can book calendly to discuss on their work.

This application can allow users to compare their coding activity with that of other developers. This feature can foster healthy competition, inspire individuals to strive for improvement, and provide benchmarks for assessing their own progress. By tracking and displaying information about users' coding activity and contributions, my application can motivate developers to improve their skills and productivity
